Situation
One of our engineers, John, had been struggling to meet project deadlines and quality standards for several months. 
Despite multiple feedback sessions and opportunities for improvement, John's performance continued to decline, negatively impacting team morale and project timelines. 
The team's workload had increased significantly due to a major product launch, and John's underperformance was starting to affect the entire team's productivity.


Task

As the Engineering Manager, my task was to assess John's performance, determine the best course of action, and communicate the decision to him in a respectful and professional manner. 
I needed to ensure that all necessary steps were taken before considering termination, including providing clear feedback, setting improvement goals, and offering support and resources.



Action

Performance Review: 
I conducted a comprehensive performance review, documenting specific instances of missed deadlines, subpar work quality, and feedback from team members. 
I also reviewed John's past performance reviews, feedback, and any relevant communication.


Feedback and Support: 
I held multiple one-on-one meetings with John to discuss his performance issues, provide constructive feedback, and outline clear expectations for improvement. 
I offered additional support and resources, such as mentorship and training opportunities, to help him get back on track.


Setting Improvement Goals: 
I set a defined timeline for improvement, establishing measurable goals that John needed to achieve within a specified period. 
I ensured that these goals were specific, achievable, and aligned with the team's objectives.


Regular Check-ins: 
I scheduled regular check-ins with John to monitor his progress, provide feedback, and address any concerns or questions he may have had.


Final Assessment: 
After the improvement period, I evaluated John's performance against the established goals. 
Unfortunately, there was insufficient progress, and the issues persisted.


Termination Meeting: 
I scheduled a private meeting with John to discuss the decision. 
I communicated the reasons for termination clearly and compassionately, ensuring that John understood the context and the steps taken prior to this decision.




Result

The outcomes of this process included:

A clear and respectful termination that minimized disruption to the team and maintained professionalism.

The remaining team members felt a sense of relief and renewed focus, as they were able to work in a more cohesive and productive environment.

The opportunity to hire a new engineer who aligned better with the team's goals and culture, ultimately leading to improved project outcomes and team dynamics.

A reduction in team stress and anxiety, as the team was no longer shouldering the burden of John's underperformance.

A renewed focus on performance management, as the team and I worked together to establish clear expectations and goals for future performance evaluations.

Question : Tell me about a time when you had to manage conflict within your team.

------------------
Abstarct: 

Situation: "Two team members had a disagreement about the direction of a project, which started to affect their collaboration."
Task: "As the project manager, it was my responsibility to resolve the conflict and ensure the project stayed on track."
Action: "I facilitated a meeting where both parties could voice their concerns. We worked together to find a compromise that satisfied both team members and was in the project's best interest."
Result: "The conflict was resolved, and the team worked cohesively, leading to the successful completion of the project."

Answer

Situation:

While working on the migration of our e-commerce application to a microservices architecture using Java/Spring Boot, 
a conflict emerged between two backend engineers. 

Engineer A proposed using Spring Data JPA with a relational database (PostgreSQL) for data persistence, 
citing its ease of use and strong support for complex queries. 

Engineer B, on the other hand, advocated for using MongoDB with Spring Data MongoDB, 
arguing that a NoSQL database would better accommodate the application's scalability needs and flexible data structure. 

This disagreement was leading to confusion in the team and delaying the project’s progress.



Task:

My task was to mediate the conflict, ensuring that both engineers felt heard 
while guiding them toward a decision that aligned with the project’s requirements and allowed us to move forward.

( mediate the conflict situation, so that 
  both felt heard, 
  help them to reach an optimistic goal aligned with project requirements,
  project do not miss any timeline/milestone,
  team morale remain high, with no confusion
)



Action:

I organized a meeting with both engineers to facilitate a constructive dialogue and reach on a constructive actionable.
I set ground rules for respectful communication, encouraged active listening.

 
During this meeting:

Engineer A presented the advantages of using Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL, including:
Strong ACID compliance and data integrity.
Familiarity with SQL for the team.
Rich querying capabilities with joins and complex transactions.

Engineer B outlined the benefits of using MongoDB, such as:
Schema flexibility, allowing for rapid changes in data structure.
Horizontal scalability, which could be beneficial as the application grows.
Faster read and write operations for unstructured data.

To aid in the decision-making process, 
I proposed that we conduct a proof-of-concept where each engineer would implement a simple service using 
their preferred data persistence method. 
This would allow us to evaluate performance, data handling capabilities, and ease of integration with the microservices architecture.




Result:

After both engineers presented their proof-of-concept implementations, 
the team was able to see the practical implications of each approach. 

They recognized the strengths of both technologies and reached a consensus to adopt a hybrid data persistence strategy:

Relational Database (PostgreSQL): Used for critical data that required strong consistency and complex relationships, 
                                  such as user accounts and transaction records.

NoSQL Database (MongoDB): Employed for more flexible data models, 
                          such as product catalogs and user-generated content, where schema evolution was necessary.

This compromise facilitated the project’s progress, 
                                enhanced collaboration between the engineers, 
                                and resulted in a more adaptable microservices architecture. 

The migration was completed on time, and 
the team reported increased morale as they appreciated the collaborative decision-making process.

Situation:
In my role as an engineering manager for a digital wallet application, 
I noticed that one of our engineers, Jamie, was consistently missing deadlines and producing lower-quality code than expected. 
This was affecting the team's overall productivity and causing delays in our project timeline.

Task:
My task was to address Jamie's performance issues proactively, provide support for improvement without demotivating him, 
and ensure that the team remained productive and motivated. 
It was crucial to handle the situation with sensitivity while maintaining team morale.

Action:
To effectively address the performance issues, I took the following steps:

Initial Assessment:
Reviewed Jamie's performance metrics, including task completion rates and code quality. 
Gathered feedback from peers to identify specific areas of concern. 

One-on-One Meeting:
Scheduled a private meeting with Jamie to discuss my observations. 
Shared specific examples of performance issues, 
focusing on the impact on the team and project deadlines. 
Clearly communicated my expectations for improvement and set specific goals. 

Development Plan:
Collaboratively created a development plan with Jamie, which included: 
Identifying areas for skill enhancement and recommending relevant training resources. 
Pairing Jamie with a more experienced engineer for mentorship. 
Scheduling regular check-ins to monitor progress and provide ongoing feedback. 

Monitoring Progress:
Conducted regular check-ins to discuss Jamie's progress, celebrate improvements, and provide constructive feedback. 
Adjusted the development plan as necessary based on Jamie's feedback and performance. 

Result:
Over the next few months, Jamie showed significant improvement in performance. 
They completed tasks on time, produced higher-quality code, 
and even began mentoring newer team members. 

The overall team morale improved as Jamie became a more engaged and contributing member of the team. 

The project was completed successfully and on schedule, and Jamie expressed gratitude for the support and guidance received.



Key Takeaways:
Proactive Management: Address performance issues promptly to prevent further impact on team productivity. 
Focus on Specifics: Use concrete examples to discuss performance issues without personal criticism. 
Collaborative Development Plans: Involve the engineer in creating a plan for improvement to foster ownership and accountability. 
Regular Feedback: Maintain open lines of communication to monitor progress and provide encouragement.

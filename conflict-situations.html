1. Conflict Over API Design

Situation: Engineer A wanted a RESTful API for payment processing, while Engineer B preferred GraphQL for its flexibility.
Task: Mediate the discussion to reach a consensus on the API design.
Action: Facilitated a meeting for both engineers to present their cases and proposed a proof-of-concept for each design.
Result: The team decided on using REST for core functionalities and GraphQL for client-facing features, meeting diverse stakeholder needs.


2. Conflict Regarding Testing Strategies

Situation: Engineer A favored extensive unit testing with JUnit, while Engineer B preferred a focus on integration testing.
Task: Help the engineers find common ground on the testing strategy.
Action: Organized a workshop for discussion and proposed a combined testing strategy.
Result: The team agreed on a strategy that included both unit tests and integration tests, improving code quality and service cohesion.


3. Conflict Over Deployment Strategies

Situation: Engineer A proposed blue-green deployment, while Engineer B favored canary releases for new features.
Task: Mediate the disagreement on deployment strategy.
Action: Facilitated a meeting to discuss the pros and cons of each strategy and suggested a risk assessment.
Result: The team adopted a hybrid deployment strategy, using blue-green for major releases and canary for smaller updates, enhancing deployment efficiency.


4. Conflict Over Data Management Approaches

Situation: Engineer A advocated for a centralized database, while Engineer B argued for a decentralized data management approach.
Task: Help the engineers reach a consensus on data management.
Action: Organized a brainstorming session and proposed a pilot project to test both approaches.
Result: The team adopted a hybrid model with centralized shared data and decentralized management for less critical information, improving data management.


5. Conflict Over Framework Choices

Situation: Engineer A preferred using Spring Boot for its features, while Engineer B wanted to use Micronaut for its lightweight nature.
Task: Mediate the discussion on the framework choice.
Action: Encouraged both engineers to present their frameworks' pros and cons and suggested a small project to evaluate both.
Result: The team decided to use Spring Boot for the main application while experimenting with Micronaut for specific microservices, balancing performance and developer familiarity.
